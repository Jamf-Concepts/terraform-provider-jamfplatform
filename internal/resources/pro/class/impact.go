// A class is a scopeable object, but it reaches devices differently from a group:
// its mobile device groups decide which devices are involved, while its students
// and teachers decide who can use them. So the alert counts the device groups —
// the part that determines which devices a class touches — and records the people
// as inputs it cannot turn into a device figure.
//
// That is why this uses the same counting as a deployable object rather than the
// membership reporting used for groups: a class has no single membership count of
// its own to report.
