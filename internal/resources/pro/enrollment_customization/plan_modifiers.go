// ModifyPlan decides whether the icon needs re-uploading, and leaves
// icon_source_hash unresolved on every plan that uploads one.
//
// Unlike the icon and branding-image stores, a customization has a real update
// endpoint, so a new icon is delivered in place rather than by replacement.
// icon_source_hash is what tells Update to upload: a plan value that differs
// from state makes it re-upload, and the two Computed values the upload settles
// — the hash and branding_settings.icon_url — go Unknown together so apply can
// supply both.
//
// Where the hash comes from depends on the source, because the two differ in
// whether two reads of the same source answer with the same bytes:
//
//   - A create leaves icon_source_hash Unknown. Create hashes the exact bytes
//     it uploads, so a source that answers two reads differently can no longer
//     plan one value and apply another (issue #373, reproduced on this resource
//     on 2026-09-04). A local path is still opened and hashed here and the hash
//     discarded, so an unreadable one fails at plan rather than part-way
//     through an apply.
//   - A local path on an existing customization is read and hashed here, and a
//     differing hash re-uploads. Local bytes are stable, so the operator sees
//     the re-upload in terraform plan.
//   - An http(s):// URL on an existing customization is not fetched here.
//     Remote content is not stable between reads, so hashing it would propose
//     an upload on plans where nothing had changed. The URL string is compared
//     instead, which does not detect content published behind an unchanged URL.
//
// A plan that leaves icon_source unset, or carries it as unknown, returns
// before any of that: prior state's hash then carries forward and Update
// uploads nothing.
//
// The destroy path returns before touching the source; a destroy needs no bytes.
