// ModifyPlan predicts what this apply will do to the two attributes publishing moves, then checks
// the tool, the schema version and the settings body against what Jamf publishes, during plan
// rather than at apply.
//
// The checks live here rather than in an attribute validator because they need the API: the tool
// catalogue and the vendor schema are server data, so there is no literal set to validate against
// and no generated SDK constant to alias. Attribute validators run before the provider is configured
// and have no client, which is what rules them out.
//
// Every check is best-effort by construction. A catalogue or schema that cannot be fetched produces
// no findings — the platform validates the write regardless, and a plan that failed because the
// provider could not reach an advisory endpoint would be worse than a plan that let the apply report
// the problem. It does not pass silently, though: the operator is told once per plan that no check
// ran, because the resource's own documentation promises the settings are checked during plan, so a
// clean plan otherwise reads as confirmation that they were.
//
// The prediction runs before the checks and independently of them, because it has to hold for a plan
// whose tool or schema version is still unknown — an unresolved interpolation stops the checks, and
// a policy whose publish state Terraform then failed to plan would be worse than an unchecked one.

// It exists because the framework marks a Computed attribute unknown only when the proposed new
// state differs from the prior state at all (fwserver.MarkComputedNilsAsUnknown, reached from
// PlanResourceChange only under that condition). So the two cases this function handles are the two
// the default gets wrong in opposite directions.
//
// A draft that survived into state with publishing enabled is planned as republished, both
// attributes unknown, so a diff exists and Update runs. Without it, the plan after a failed publish
// is empty: state records has_draft true, config equals state, nothing goes unknown, and Terraform
// never calls Update — leaving blueprints delivering the previous version's settings for good, with
// nothing anywhere to say so. Two facts make republishing safe rather than presumptuous. First, a
// persistent has_draft with config equal to state has essentially one cause, a failed publish:
// aigovernance.PolicyDetail's Settings and SchemaVersion are the *draft's* values, so a refresh
// pulls an admin's UI edits into state, config then differs from it, and the ordinary settings diff
// reverts them — a UI draft whose settings differ from the configuration never reaches this branch,
// and one whose settings match it is harmless to publish. Second, the retry works: wire-probed on
// 2026-08-30, a PATCH sending settings identical to an existing draft answers 204 and leaves
// hasDraft true — the draft survives an identical write — and the POST /publish that follows answers
// 201 with versionNumber 2 rather than 409 NO_DRAFT_TO_PUBLISH.
//
// The reverse optimisation — holding published_version at its prior value when the settings are
// semantically equal, so that a rename does not make every blueprint interpolating the number plan an
// in-place update — was implemented and then removed deliberately. Do not restore it. It can only
// ever fire when something else about the policy changed, because that is the sole condition under
// which the framework marks the number unknown at all; and that is exactly the condition under which
// Update runs and reads the real number back. So every firing of the hold is a firing where the
// prediction can be contradicted, and it is contradicted whenever a version was published outside
// Terraform since the state was last refreshed — an admin publishing in the admin UI is a supported
// workflow, not an edge case. The contradiction surfaces as "Provider produced inconsistent result
// after apply", which tells the operator the provider is broken when it is not. An unknown is the
// truthful plan for a number this provider does not own: UseStateForUnknown is safe on id and
// created_at because those cannot change, and published_version can.
