// Package enumguard is the recurrence guard for restating a value the SDK
// already generates.
//
// Enum values and machine-readable error codes must come from the SDK's
// generated constants, never from a string literal — see STYLE_GUIDE.md
// §"Enum values and error codes come from the SDK, not from literals". That
// rule failed twice by review, so every package declaring such values pins it
// with a test rather than trusting a reader to notice.
//
// The check parses the package's own source rather than taking a hand-written
// list, so it cannot drift. It fires in both directions: on a literal that the
// SDK covers today, and — through [Check]'s Absent map — on a literal that a
// future SDK release promotes into an enum.
//
// It walks const *and* var declarations, including the elements of slice and
// map composite literals, because a restated enum is far more often a
// `var validFoos = []string{...}` feeding a OneOf validator than a lone const.
// It also reaches inside function bodies for three shapes. Two are the framework
// calls that declare an accepted set in all but name — stringvalidator.OneOf and
// stringdefault.StaticString — since a schema that inlines its vocabulary is
// restating it just as surely as a package-level var would. The third is a short
// variable declaration, `v := "install"`, which is how a builder names the one
// wire value it is about to send. That third shape was missing until this
// package's own review found five shipped packages whose only restated enum had
// it, leaving those guards unable to protect their own source.
//
// It reads every non-test file in the package directory, so moving a
// declaration between files cannot slip past it.
//
// What it deliberately does not cover: a literal that is not declared but merely
// used — compared against in ordinary logic (`if cdnType == "AMAZON_S3"`, `case
// "PENDING":`), returned (`return "PENDING"`), passed as an argument to anything
// but the two framework calls above, or assigned to a field of a struct literal
// built inside a function. Reaching those would mean treating every string in
// the package as an enum reference, which fires on prose and on unrelated
// vocabularies that happen to share a spelling. Those are an audit's job, not a
// guard's. The line the walker draws is declaration versus use: a short variable
// declaration is collected because the name it binds is the value the code goes
// on to send, whereas the same literal one line later in a `case` is only being
// recognised.

	//
	// Leaving it empty is itself reported as [Findings.Vacuous]: a caller that
	// names no vocabulary asserts nothing, so a package with no vocabulary left
	// to restate must record the gap and drop its test rather than keep a test
	// that cannot fail.
	Covered []string

	// Absent maps a value this package must restate to the reason the SDK
	// carries no constant for it. Stating the reason per value is the point:
	// a comment claiming "the SDK has none of these" is the exact shape of
	// the defect this guard exists to catch, because it is usually true of
	// some values and false of others.
	//
	// An entry that Covered turns out to contain is itself a failure — that
	// is how the guard reports an SDK release promoting a literal into an
	// enum.
	Absent map[string]string

	// Ignore lists literal values that are not members of any vocabulary in
	// Covered, even though they spell one. Two shapes: something that is not
	// an enum value at all — an attribute name, a map key, a sentinel, an
	// English noun — and a genuine member of a *different* vocabulary that
	// the SDK does not generate. Each entry needs a reason for the same
	// reason Absent does.
	//
	// The distinction from Absent matters: Absent asserts the SDK carries no
	// constant for the value and is therefore checked against Covered, so an
	// SDK release that starts generating it fails. Ignore asserts the value
	// belongs to a different set, which a foreign vocabulary gaining or
	// losing the spelling says nothing about, so it is not checked. Putting a
	// cross-vocabulary collision in Absent reports a spurious promotion.

	// is the one an SDK release causes on its own, by withdrawing the last
