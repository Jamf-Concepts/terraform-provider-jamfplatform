// This file transcribes Jamf's "Jamf Pro permissions map" documentation
// article: the permission name and grouping Jamf Account shows for every GA
// capability. It is the only artefact that carries the mapping — the OpenAPI
// specs publish the capability slug and nothing else — so it is maintained by
// hand and guarded by TestCatalogueCoversEverySDKCapability, which fails when
// the SDK starts requiring a capability this file has never heard of.
//
// Source: the permissionsMapURL below.
// Transcribed 2026-08-31 from the revised version of that article which the
// Platform API spec references. The published page lagged that revision at the
// time of transcription and is expected to catch up, so a row here may lead the
// page rather than follow it — check the spec's reference before concluding a
// row is wrong. The URL itself is stable.
//
// No test asserts what an entry SAYS. TestCatalogueCoversEverySDKCapability
// checks only that a required capability HAS a row, so a wrong section or a
// wrong permission name is invisible to it; catalogue.golden pins the rendered
// triples so an edited row shows up as a reviewable diff, but nothing can
// compare a name against Jamf's article. Re-verify by reading the article.
//
// The transcription is deliberately complete rather than trimmed to what this
// provider calls: an entry costs one line, and keeping the file a faithful copy
// of the article makes it diffable against the next revision of it. So the
// organization-management, Jamf Protect and Secure Enterprise Access rows are
// present even though no construct here reaches some of them.

// permissionsMapURL is Jamf's "Jamf Pro permissions map" article: the page this
// file transcribes, and the page a rendered table sends a reader to when it has
// no permission name recorded for a capability. Jamf Account's picker is
// searched by permission name, not by API capability slug, and the two differ
// substantially — computer-inventory-collection-settings is "Device inventory
// collection settings" — so the article is the only way to get from a slug to
// the box to tick.

// be reordered without anything being renamed, and no test here could tell.
