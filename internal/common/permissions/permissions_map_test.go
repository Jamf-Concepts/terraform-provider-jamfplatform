// catalogue.go used to say of itself: "No test asserts what an entry SAYS.
// TestCatalogueCoversEverySDKCapability checks only that a required capability
// HAS a row, so a wrong section or a wrong permission name is invisible to it."
// This is that test, and the header no longer says it.
//
// It became possible because jamfplatform-go-sdk v0.21.0 committed a snapshot
// of the published permissions map and parses it as a privilege oracle, which
// established that the article's markdown rendering is machine-readable. The
// SDK reads only the Capability column — its parser discards both the
// Permission name and the "###" headings — so the two dimensions this file
// needs are the two nobody upstream consumes. jamfpro-cli reached the same
// conclusion independently and carries the sibling of this test; the two should
// move together.
//
// What this proves and what it does not: it removes drift between the
// transcription and the article, and it does NOT verify that the article
// matches what Jamf Account's picker actually prints. Nothing reachable from
// here can do the latter, which is why permissionsMapURL still appears in a
// rendered table with no recorded row.
//
// permissions-map.md beside this file is a verbatim copy fetched from
// permissionsMapURL. Refresh it with `make permissions-map` and read the diff:
// a name or a section moving is a real change to what an operator is told to
// look for, not housekeeping.
//
// The article is the source of truth, so its spelling is taken verbatim and
// there is deliberately no exception mechanism. A future divergence that is
// genuinely wanted gets a self-expiring exception map — an entry that stops
// disagreeing must fail — rather than a silent edit to catalogue.go.
