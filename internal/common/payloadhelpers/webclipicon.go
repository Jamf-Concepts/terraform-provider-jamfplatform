// webClipPayloadType is the one payload type carrying an icon. Apple's

// keys, and only this one is an image: the others are certificates
// (com.apple.security.{pem,pkcs1,pkcs12,root,scep}, com.apple.eas.account,
// com.apple.MCX.FileVault2, com.apple.systempolicy.rule), a font
// (com.apple.font), two VPN secrets (com.apple.vpn.managed IKEv2.PPK and
// IPSec.SharedSecret) and an SSO group identifier. Wire-probed 2026-09-09
// against Jamf Pro 11.3x in eu: a certificate, a font and a VPN shared secret
// all come back byte-identical, so this exception is genuinely icon-only and
// must not be widened to data blobs in general — a re-rendered certificate
// would be real corruption, and tolerating it would hide that.

// Icon re-render wire law, probed 2026-09-09 against Jamf Pro 11.3x (eu) over
// eight icons on jamfplatform_pro_mobile_device_configuration_profile:
//
//   - Jamf Pro ALWAYS re-renders the icon. It never stores the submitted bytes,
//     not even when they are already a 180x180 PNG (a 415-byte 180x180 RGBA PNG
//     came back as 558 bytes).
//   - The stored form is always a PNG carrying only IHDR/IDAT/IEND — every
//     ancillary chunk is stripped — scaled so its longest side is 180px with the
//     aspect ratio preserved (8x8 -> 180x180 upscaled, 120x120 -> 180x180,
//     200x100 -> 180x90) and the source colour model kept (an RGB source stays
//     colour type 2, an RGBA source stays 6).
//   - A JPEG or GIF is accepted and converted to PNG.
//   - The re-render is deterministic: storing one icon twice yields
//     byte-identical blobs, which is why an icon read back out of Jamf Pro and
//     re-submitted verbatim does round-trip (the byte fast path below).
//   - Bytes that are not an image at all — including an empty blob — are
//     replaced by a fixed 180x180 placeholder PNG. That must NOT compare equal
//     to whatever was authored, and it does not: an undecodable authored side
//     falls through to the byte comparison, which fails, and the operator is
//     told the icon is not a decodable image.
//
// So a byte comparison of an authored icon against the stored one can only ever
// succeed for an icon that came out of Jamf Pro in the first place. Replicating
// the re-render is not an option either — it would mean matching another
// encoder's zlib settings and filter choices exactly. The comparison therefore
// normalises both sides and compares content.
const (
	// iconGrid is the resolution both icons are box-filtered down to before
	// comparison. Small enough that neither side's resampler shows through,
	// large enough to keep two different icons far apart.
	iconGrid = 16

	// iconMeanDeltaTolerance is the mean per-channel difference (0-255) below
	// which two normalised icons count as the same image.
	//
	// Measured on the same probe run, over a 6x6 colour checkerboard with a
	// diagonal gradient and a high-frequency concentric-ring pattern (the
	// adversarial case for a resampler): the same icon compared against Jamf
	// Pro's re-render of it scored a mean delta of 0.65 and 2.38, while two
	// different icons scored 45.1. The threshold sits an order of magnitude
	// above the observed re-render noise and a factor of five below a real icon
	// change, so it does not need retuning for a slightly different resampler
	// on either side.
	//
	// Sensitivity floor, and it is a real one: a localized edit is averaged
	// over the whole iconGrid x iconGrid grid, so a change confined to a few
	// percent of the icon's area reads as unchanged. Measured on a 64x64 icon
	// by replicating this algorithm exactly, an opaque badge painted over the
	// bottom-right corner scores a mean delta of 2.0 at 1/8 x 1/8 of the side
	// (1.6% of the area), 3.1 at 1/6 x 1/6 (2.8%) and 8.0 at 1/4 x 1/4 (6.2%);
	// a global +20 shift on one channel across the whole icon scores 3.9. So
	// the first two of those are inside the tolerance and the provider calls
	// them the same picture. Raising the tolerance is not the answer — the
	// observed re-render noise runs to 2.38, which leaves no room above it —
	// and catching a corner badge would take a different comparison, not a
	// different threshold.
	//
	// Trade-off: the tolerance governs the comparisons where one side is a
	// server response — the post-write verification of what Jamf Pro stored,
	// and the plan-time two-way fallback that compares a planned payload
	// against the last state read back from the server. A near-identical
	// out-of-band edit to the icon therefore reads as unchanged in those
	// comparisons. That buys tolerance of a re-render no client can reproduce,
	// which is the only way an icon can round-trip at all.
	iconMeanDeltaTolerance = 8.0

	// iconMaxDimension bounds what is decoded. An icon is at most a few hundred
	// pixels square — Jamf Pro stores 180px on the longest side, and Apple's
	// own icon guidance stays far below this cap — so anything larger is
	// either a mistake or a decompression bomb, and is left to the byte
	// comparison rather than expanded in memory. The cap is deliberately close
	// to the observed forms: every comparison walks the decoded image pixel by
	// pixel on a plan-time path, so the ceiling is a megapixel budget as much
	// as a safety bound.

// nothing was re-rendered, so there is nothing to report. Beyond that it
// answers false whenever it cannot tell — either side undecodable, absurdly
