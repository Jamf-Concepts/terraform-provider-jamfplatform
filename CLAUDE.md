# Repository Guidelines

## Overview

Terraform provider for Jamf Platform APIs, built on the [Terraform Plugin Framework](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-framework) v1.19.0 with Protocol v6. Go module path: `github.com/Jamf-Concepts/terraform-provider-jamfplatform`.

Five construct types: **resources** (CRUD), **data sources** (read-only lookups), **list resources** (RSQL-filtered streaming), **actions** (fire-and-forget device commands), and **functions** (offline provider-defined functions under the `jamfplatform::` namespace — no API client, no provider config).

The Jamf Platform API client is the external Go SDK `github.com/Jamf-Concepts/jamfplatform-go-sdk` (package `jamfplatform`). Not vendored.

## Impact alerts — one-paragraph orientation

`internal/common/impact/` produces Jamf Pro's **impact alert notifications** during `terraform plan`: an advisory warning on each object whose scope or payload is changing, reporting how many computers or mobile devices the change reaches. Off by default behind the provider's `impact_alerts` attribute; a nil `*impact.Cache` means disabled, so resources need no flag check. Three channels. Two mirror Jamf's own split — **deployable** (policies, profiles, apps, blueprints, benchmarks) and **scopeable** (groups, classes) — because a resource's `ModifyPlan` cannot see a sibling's, so a plan editing both a group and something scoped to it needs an alert from each side. The third, **policy dependencies** (script, package, printer, Dock item, directory binding, disk encryption configuration), has no counterpart in Jamf Pro: these objects have no scope of their own, so their blast radius is the combined audience of the policies referencing them. Resources wire in via `impact.ReportPlan` (deployable), `impact.ReportMembership` (scopeable) or `impact.ReportDependencyPlan` (dependencies), plus a per-family adapter — a reducer to `impact.Scope` for the first two, and for a dependency only a reader for the object's id and name. The shared Jamf Pro scope block goes through `scope.BuildImpactScope`, which is the single place the narrows/broadens/counts classification lives. Dependencies need a whole-tenant policy sweep, since Jamf Pro has no reverse lookup ("which policies use this script"): lazy, at most once per configured provider instance, self-capped at 5 concurrent reads, and built by `impact.NewCacheWithPolicies` (`NewTenantCache` wires both sources). Alerts are advisory — a tenant that cannot be read yields one notice and never fails a plan. Two rules that are easy to get wrong: a numeric Jamf Pro group id is unique only **within an estate** (see [STYLE_GUIDE.md §Scope helper](STYLE_GUIDE.md#scope-helper)), and group membership is expressed in **device management identifiers**, so a Jamf Pro numeric device/building/department id must be resolved through the inventory before it can be compared with a group's members. User guidance, including the `terraform plan -json` caveat, is in `docs/guides/impact-alerts.md`.

## Apple profile schemas — one-paragraph orientation

`internal/common/appleprofiles/` carries a generated table of Apple's configuration profile payload
keys, built from the `mdm/profiles` directory of apple/device-management by `make apple-profiles`
(never part of `make generate` — it needs a network clone, and upstream only moves a few times a
year). Jamf's blueprints service validates a stored legacy payload against the same vocabulary, and
wire probing established exactly how: an unknown **payload type** is rejected and matched
case-sensitively; an unknown **key** is silently discarded; a key differing only in case is silently
stored under Apple's spelling; a wrong value type or a missing required key fails the write; enum and
range constraints are **not** enforced (`AlertType: 99` stores fine), so the table does not check
them either. `appleprofiles.Validate` turns those rules into `Problem` values, and
`Problem.Advisory()` says how far to trust each one — a name the table does not recognise is a
warning, because a key Apple added after the snapshot looks identical to one that never existed;
everything else is an error, because Jamf refuses the write. Descent stops at a free-form
(wildcard) dictionary: everything under an MCX preference domain
(`com.apple.ManagedClient.preferences`, the "Custom Settings" envelope) is passthrough, and Jamf
stops validating there too. The blueprint resource wires this in through `validators.go` for both
`component_blocks[].legacy_payloads` and the deprecated top-level `legacy_payloads`. Freshness is a
scheduled concern, not a plan-time one: `.github/workflows/apple-profiles.yml` regenerates monthly
and opens a pull request, the same reviewable-PR pattern Dependabot uses here.

## Jamf Security Cloud resources — one-paragraph orientation

Terraform construct name format: `jamfplatform_security_cloud_<resource>`; Go package
`internal/resources/security_cloud/<resource>/`, flat single tier like `pro/`. All five
Security Cloud API namespaces (`jsc-categories`, `jsc-dns`, `jsc-ztna`,
`securitycloud-devices`, `uem-connect`) are generated into one SDK package,
`jamfplatform/securitycloud`, and every method routes through the unified
`/securitycloud` prefix — wire-verified in production EU on 2026-08-27 for the DNS
surface and 2026-08-29 for UEM Connect, both under a tenant-scoped integration. There is
no `/api` segment: the Platform API GA dropped it everywhere, and a request carrying it
gets the gateway's own bare `404 page not found` rather than a JSON error. Configure goes through
`providerdata.ConfigureSecurityCloud`, **not** `ConfigurePro`: Security Cloud is
continuously deployed with no customer-tenant version, and a tenant can hold it without
holding Jamf Pro, so a Pro version fetch would be both meaningless and fatal. Two things
differ from every other namespace and are easy to get wrong. First, **entitlement is not
authentication** — a valid integration can still be refused with `403 NOT_ENTITLED`, so
resources translate that code into a named diagnostic instead of surfacing the raw error.
Second, **cross-namespace references are server-enforced in both directions**: a DNS
zone's name servers each name a gateway by ID — a shared, dedicated or grouped gateway, all
three accepted — and a zone cannot be written before its gateway exists
(`422 GATEWAY_NOT_FOUND`), so that diagnostic points at `authoritative_name_servers` rather than
the zone; conversely a gateway that anything still references refuses to be deleted with a bare
`409 CONFLICT` naming nothing, which is a Terraform destroy-ordering trap and gets its own
diagnostic. That last behaviour is **per construct, not a namespace rule** — a device group
that a ZTNA app still names deletes cleanly and silently empties the app's assignment instead
— so probe the referenced delete for each new construct rather than inheriting either answer.
Three shapes recur across the namespace and are worth knowing before reading any of
it: a **cipher/algorithm field is an array the server accepts exactly one element in**, so it
is modelled as a single string and collapsed at the boundary; an **enum violation is
unattributed, but not identically so across services** — `jsc-dns` and `jsc-ztna` answer
`400 [INVALID_FIELD] Request body is missing or malformed.` with no field and no value,
while `uem-connect` answers `422 VALIDATION_FAILED` leaking Jackson's message, which does
name the accepted values; either way every enum is validated at plan time from the SDK's
own generated `*Values()` helper rather than a restated list, and the per-service
difference is one more reason not to write a diagnostic against a code another construct
observed; and an **unmapped route answers `403 BAD_PERMISSIONS`,
indistinguishable from a real privilege gap** (a bogus path returns the same body), so that
code is deliberately never translated into a diagnostic and a spec-advertised endpoint the
gateway 403s on is presumed unrouted rather than unprivileged. Acceptance tests gate on
`testhelpers.AccPreCheckSecurityCloud`, which requires the operator to *declare* that the
configured scope is a Security Cloud one (`JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_SECURITYCLOUD_{ENVIRONMENT,TENANT}_ID`,
matching the scope in use) and skips otherwise — a Pro-only acceptance tenant is a
legitimate environment, not a failure. Full rules:
[STYLE_GUIDE.md §Jamf Security Cloud Resource Naming](STYLE_GUIDE.md#jamf-security-cloud-resource-naming).

## Jamf Account — one-paragraph orientation

Terraform construct name format: `jamfplatform_account_<x>`; Go package
`internal/resources/account/<x>/`, flat single tier like `security_cloud/`. This is the provider's
**organization-level** family — what a practitioner manages at *account.jamf.com → Organization*,
above and across individual tenants. Today that means **SSO**: a `sso_domain` is a DNS domain the
organization has claimed and proved ownership of, and a `sso_connection` — shipped as a resource,
two data sources and a list resource — is an OIDC identity-provider connection that signs users in
for one or more of those domains, scoped to chosen Jamf Pro, School, Protect and Security Cloud
tenants. Family
facts and the naming rationale are in
[STYLE_GUIDE.md §Jamf Account Resource Naming](STYLE_GUIDE.md#jamf-account-resource-naming); five
things drive the design and are easy to get wrong. First, **this is the only family reachable under
organization scope, and the only scope that reaches it** — wire-probed 2026-09-02 on two
organization-scoped integrations, while a tenant-scoped one is refused `403 BAD_PERMISSIONS` on the
same URL in the same region (provably an authorization refusal rather than an unrouted path, because
another credential answers 200 there). Environment scope is *untested*, not ruled out: the namespace
exists only on the **US gateway**, so no US environment-scoped integration was available, and
widening `ConfigureAccount`'s gate is a fresh probe rather than a one-token edit. No organization ID
travels anywhere — the gateway resolves it from the access token, so there is no `organization_id`
attribute and no SDK `WithOrganizationID`. Second, **a domain is create/verify/delete only**: `GET`,
`PUT` and `PATCH` on `/sso/v1/domains/{id}` all answer `403 BAD_PERMISSIONS`, which by this repo's
law means unrouted — so every attribute is `RequiresReplace`, Read scans the list endpoint, and
import is by domain **name**. Third, **verification is an action, not resource state, and it is not
idempotent**: a *failed* verify returns `200` with `domainStatus` unchanged (so the status code says
nothing), yet still bumps `lastModifiedDate` and pushes `verificationExpirationDate` out 14 days —
and because the five-minute rate limit is measured from `lastModifiedDate`, which the claim itself
sets, the first verify after creating a domain is always refused. Fourth, two things about a connection, and note which
endpoint each belongs to, because getting that backwards is easy. **Its tenant allow-list is
write-only**: neither read shape echoes `enabledProducts` or `enabledEnvironments`, and no endpoint
anywhere lists an organization's tenants, so the ids can be neither discovered nor drift-checked —
documented rather than solved. And **changing one in place is impossible, though creating one is
not**: `POST` answers `201` for a valid body, and reading, importing, the data sources, the list
resource and deleting all work, but `PUT /sso/v1/connections/{id}` answers `500 UPSTREAM_ERROR` for
*every* request — including the verbatim body a create had just accepted — and wire-verified
2026-09-03 the refused write applies nothing, a connection read back after a PUT changing three
fields being byte-identical. So `sso_connection` carries a whole-resource `ModifyPlan` that plans a
**replacement** on any configured change, in one file rather than fifty `RequiresReplace` modifiers
so that reverting it is deleting a file; the `Update` method and its acceptance test are already
written and gated behind `skipUnlessConnectionUpdatesWork`, ready for the day Jamf fixes the
endpoint. Fifth,
**the server attributes almost nothing**: `errors[].field` is populated only for top-level required
fields, an invalid enum returns `MALFORMED_REQUEST_BODY` with `field: null` and never names the
value, and a `connectionType`-versus-payload mismatch is an unattributed `500` — so every enum is
taken from the SDK's own `*Values()` helper rather than a restated list, and the connection's
discriminator/payload pairing will be validated at plan time the same way once it ships.

## Jamf AI Governance — one-paragraph orientation

Terraform construct name format: `jamfplatform_ai_governance_<x>`; Go package
`internal/resources/ai_governance/<x>/`, flat single tier like `security_cloud/`. An **AI policy** is
the managed configuration for one AI tool — Claude Code, Claude Desktop or OpenAI Codex today — which
Jamf Pro then delivers to Macs through a blueprint's `com.jamf.ai-governance` component. Family is
**Platform Services**: hand-rolled Configure, no version gate, no SDK-endpoints annotation block —
but the scope gate is `ScopeEnvironment` **alone**, and both alternatives are wire-probed: a request
carrying no scope header is refused with `400 REQUEST_CONTEXT_NOT_PROVIDED`, and one carrying
`X-Tenant-Id` is refused with `403 BAD_PERMISSIONS` — while `GET /pro/v1/csa/tenant-id` under that
same header answers 200, so the header is accepted and the refusal belongs to this namespace. By this
repo's own law (§Jamf Security Cloud: `403 BAD_PERMISSIONS` is indistinguishable from a privilege
gap, so a spec-advertised route answering it is presumed unrouted) AI Governance is **not reachable**
under tenant scope, and widening the gate is a fresh probe rather than a one-token edit. (Note this
retires the Phase 11 epic's recorded blocker, which had the namespace down as organization-scope and
therefore unbuildable; and the path is `/ai/governance/policies/v1/...`, not `/api/ai-governance/...`.)
Four things drive the design and are easy to get wrong. First, **the settings body is the tool vendor's
own JSON**, declared by a JSON Schema the platform serves per tool per schema version, 142 top-level
properties for Claude Code and deeply nested for Codex — so it is one `settings_json` string
attribute with JSON semantic equality, never generated typed attributes (schema versions coexist per
policy, `anyOf` unions have no framework equivalent, and two Claude Code schema versions shipped in
three months). `internal/common/aischemas` fetches, caches and validates it at plan time; its
partiality is measured, not assumed, and its package doc says which keywords are skipped and why.
Second, **validation strength is a property of the vendor schema, not the service**: an undeclared key
is silently *stored and never applied* where the schema allows extras (Claude Code) and rejected with
`422` where it does not (Codex) — which is why an unrecognised key is a warning and everything else an
error, and why it is the one failure the service itself never reports. Third, **a policy has a draft
and a published history**: create publishes nothing, a blueprint pins a *version number*, the platform
diffs settings itself so an apply changing only the name mints no version — and `schemaVersion` is
part of neither diff, so moving a policy to a newer schema *without* touching the settings publishes
nothing and leaves blueprints delivering the old schema. Fourth, **archiving is not blocked by a
blueprint that references the policy**: the delete succeeds and leaves the blueprint pointing at a
version the platform will no longer serve, with no reverse lookup to warn from
(`GET /policies/{id}/deployment` returns an empty list even for a deployed referencing blueprint), so
that trap is documentation only — the opposite of the ZTNA gateway law, and one more reason to probe
referenced deletes per construct. User guidance is in `docs/guides/ai-governance-policies.md`.

## Jamf Pro resources — one-paragraph orientation

Terraform construct name format: `jamfplatform_pro_<resource>` regardless of whether the SDK source is `pro/` or `proclassic/`. One `jamfplatform.Client` built from `JAMFPLATFORM_*` credentials serves both Platform Services and Pro. Every Pro resource declares an unexported `const minJamfProVersion` and funnels Configure through `providerdata.ConfigurePro` (no hand-rolled boilerplate). Each Pro resource's `crud.go` opens with an SDK-endpoints annotation block (`Status: current. Last reviewed YYYY-MM-DD.`) — Pro / ProClassic only; Platform Services resources are exempt. Full rules: [STYLE_GUIDE.md §Jamf Pro Resource Naming](STYLE_GUIDE.md#jamf-pro-resource-naming), §Minimum Jamf Pro version check, §Endpoint adoption & migration policy. Workflow for adding a Pro resource (incl. SDK-comparison + ProClassic payload audit gate): [CONTRIBUTING.md §Adding a Jamf Pro Resource](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-jamf-pro-resource).

## API integration scope — one-paragraph orientation

Jamf offers three scopes when an API integration is created, and the provider mirrors all three: **Platform environment** (a group of tenants across product types — the *preferred* scope, `environment_id` → `X-Environment-Id`), **Tenant** (a single Jamf Pro / School / Protect / Security Cloud tenant — Jamf's own words are "legacy method for targeting integrations without a platform environment", `tenant_id` → `X-Tenant-Id`), and **Organization management** (SSO, AI Governance and similar organization-level resources — no scope header at all; the gateway resolves the context from the access token). Since SDK v0.17.0 the scope travels in a header rather than the URL path, set by `WithEnvironmentID` / `WithTenantID`. So `environment_id` and `tenant_id` are **mutually exclusive and both optional** — an integration targets one, and supplying the other is refused with `403 OWNERSHIP_FORBIDDEN` even when both IDs belong to the same customer. `internal/provider/scope.go` resolves which is in play (config beats environment; both-at-once is an error either way; a shadowed env var warns) and selects the SDK option accordingly; `providerdata.New` then reads the scope back off the built client via `Client.Scope()` (SDK v0.18.0), so the gate can never disagree with the header the client actually sends. Whether a given construct can be reached under that scope is then enforced **per construct**, not once in provider Configure, via `providerdata.RequireScope` in `internal/providerdata/scope.go` — because the answer differs per API family and is about to differ more: Jamf Pro works under either scope (gated once inside `configureSub`, covering every `pro/` package and Pro action), Security Cloud likewise works under either and is gated once inside `ConfigureSecurityCloud`, while Blueprints and Compliance Benchmarks become environment-only at the Platform API GA, at which point their call sites drop `ScopeTenant`. Pass the allowed kinds in preference order, environment first — it is the order the diagnostic lists them in. Organization scope is **not** a rejected special case: it is the only scope that reaches the `jamfplatform_account_*` family (Jamf Account SSO), gated once inside `ConfigureAccount`, and it is rejected everywhere else. Enforcement runs both ways for the same reason — an organization-scoped integration aimed at a Pro resource, or an environment-scoped one aimed at a Jamf Account resource, each turn an opaque gateway failure mid-apply into a named diagnostic at Configure.

## Tooling

- Go >= 1.26, Terraform >= 1.13.0.
- `GNUmakefile` is the canonical entrypoint. Default target: `fmt lint install generate`.
- Releases built with goreleaser (`goreleaser.yml`).
- `make generate` → `tools/tools.go`: copyright headers (`hashicorp/copywrite`), `terraform fmt -recursive ../examples/`, provider docs (`hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs`).

| Target | Description |
|---|---|
| `build` | Build the provider |
| `install` | Build and install locally |
| `fmt` | `gofmt -s -w -e .` |
| `fix` | `go fix ./...` — rewrites deprecated API usages |
| `lint` | `golangci-lint run` |
| `generate` | Copyright headers + `terraform fmt examples/` + docs |
| `apple-profiles` | Regenerate `internal/common/appleprofiles/profiles.json` from apple/device-management (network; not part of `generate`) |
| `test` | Unit tests (excludes `acceptance` build tag) |
| `test-scripts` | Unit tests for `scripts/acctargets` (behind the `acctargets` build tag, so `go test ./...` misses it) |
| `testacc` | Acceptance tests (sets `TF_ACC=1`, requires tenant) |
| `testacc-run` | Targeted acc rerun (`RUN=<regex> PKG=<path>`) |

Before committing: `make fix fmt lint test`. Then `make generate` if any schema description or example changed.

## Environment Variables

- `JAMFPLATFORM_BASE_URL` — `https://us.api.jamfcloud.com` / `eu.api.jamfcloud.com` / `apac.api.jamfcloud.com`. The gateway root, host only: it serves `/auth/token` and every namespace at the root, so a `/api` path breaks authentication. The beta `{region}.apigw.jamf.com` was retired at the Platform API GA.
- `JAMFPLATFORM_CLIENT_ID` / `JAMFPLATFORM_CLIENT_SECRET` — API client credentials.
- `JAMFPLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_ID` — platform-environment scope, sent as `X-Environment-Id`. **Preferred.**
- `JAMFPLATFORM_TENANT_ID` — tenant scope, sent as `X-Tenant-Id`. **Legacy.** Mutually exclusive with the above; both are optional — see §API integration scope.
- `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_ORGANIZATION_DECLARED_ID` — **acceptance tests only**. Declares that the configured credentials are an organization-scoped integration, which is what the `jamfplatform_account_*` family requires. There is nothing to compare it against — an organization-scoped request carries no scope header, so no `JAMFPLATFORM_*` variable holds the organization — and that is exactly why the declaration is needed: without it a Pro-only credential set with both scope variables unset looks identical to a real organization integration. `testhelpers.AccPreCheckAccount` additionally requires **both** `JAMFPLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_ID` and `JAMFPLATFORM_TENANT_ID` to be *unset*, and skips on a non-US base URL, since `/sso/v1` is served only from the US gateway.
- `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_ORGANIZATION_SSO_VERIFIED_DOMAIN` / `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_ORGANIZATION_SSO_UNVERIFIABLE_DOMAIN` — **acceptance tests only**, both optional, both naming a *claimed* Jamf Account SSO domain. The first must be a **real, already-verified** domain the operator owns; the second a throwaway `.example` one, which can never verify. They cover the two verification outcomes the suite cannot manufacture: re-checking a verified domain is refused `409 CONFLICT` (which the action reports as success), and checking an unverifiable one returns `200` with the status unchanged. The **first-time** unverified→verified transition is untestable by design — the verification key is reissued on every claim, so a DNS record published for an earlier claim is stale against a new one, and automating it would require the suite to write DNS.
- `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_AIGOVERNANCE_ENVIRONMENT_ID` — **acceptance tests only**. Declares that the configured environment holds Jamf AI Governance; must equal `JAMFPLATFORM_ENVIRONMENT_ID`. Unset or mismatched, every AI Governance acceptance test skips locally and **fails** in the `aigovernance` lane, which names this variable in its `require` token — it was referenced by no workflow at all before the lane pipeline, so all 18 tests skipped green on every run. Environment scope only — there is no tenant form, because the surface answers a request carrying no scope header with `REQUEST_CONTEXT_NOT_PROVIDED` and one carrying `X-Tenant-Id` with `403 BAD_PERMISSIONS`, which this repo reads as an unrouted namespace.
- `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_PRO_ADCS_API_CLIENT_ID` — **acceptance tests only**. Client ID (UUID) of a pre-existing Jamf Pro API client holding the AD CS certificate-job privileges. `jamfplatform_pro_pki_adcs` in `OUTBOUND` mode needs one and the provider can no longer create it: the API-client and API-role endpoints were withdrawn at the Platform API GA, so clients are created in Jamf Account. Unset and the two OUTBOUND tests skip.
- `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_SECURITYCLOUD_ENVIRONMENT_ID` / `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_SECURITYCLOUD_TENANT_ID` — **acceptance tests only**. Declares that the configured scope belongs to a Jamf Security Cloud tenant; must equal the corresponding `JAMFPLATFORM_*` value. Unset or mismatched, every Security Cloud acceptance test skips locally and **fails** in the `securitycloud` lane, which names the environment form in its `require` token. The environment form is wired in CI (wire-verified 2026-09-03); the tenant form is not, and the ZTNA gateway tests require it: `tenantIds` is mandatory on a gateway and no API exposes an environment's tenants, so an environment-scoped run cannot supply one. See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).
- `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_REQUIRE` — **acceptance tests only**. A comma-separated list of lane `require` tokens (`platform`, `environment`, `organization`, `securitycloud`, `aigovernance`, `pro-tenant`). It promotes an unset-credential *skip* into a *failure* for the named sets, and `.github/workflows/acceptance.yml` sets it per lane from `matrix.require`. Unset it locally and everything skips as before, which is what lets a contributor with no estate run `make testacc`. See §Acceptance CI lanes.
- Every other acceptance-only variable is named `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_<PRODUCT>_<FIELD>`, matching `jamfplatform-go-sdk` — verbatim where that repo already names the same secret, so one value serves both (hence `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_PRO_DEP_TOKEN` and `JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_SECURITYCLOUD_UEM_PRO_TENANT_ID`, neither of which is what this repo would have chosen alone). The full rename map, and the dual-read shim that keeps a stale local `.env` working, are in `internal/testhelpers/accrequire/env.go`. The variables listed *above* this line are the exception and must never be renamed: the provider schema reads them at Configure and they are documented for users, so the SDK alignment happens at the **secret** layer, with `acceptance.yml` mapping the aligned secret onto the provider's own variable.
- Acceptance tests additionally require `TF_ACC=1` (set automatically by `make testacc`), and one of the two scope variables.

## Acceptance CI lanes — one-paragraph orientation

`.github/workflows/acceptance.yml` runs acceptance as **product lanes**, not one serial suite.
`.github/acceptance-lanes.json` is the single source of truth, read by `scripts/acclanes` (which
builds the GitHub matrix) and by `internal/conformance/acc_lanes_test.go` (which proves the
partition is honest, untagged, in `make test`, with no credentials). A lane is a product space and
membership is a **package path prefix** — the divergence from the SDK, whose suite is one package
and so splits on a test-name regex and hands `go test -run` a 34 KB alternation; here the package
list goes straight to `go test`, 4.9 KB for the pro lane's 110 packages. Six lanes are active —
`account`, `securitycloud`, `aigovernance`, `platform-env`, `pro-tenant`, and `pro` as the default
that owns everything unclaimed — plus `protect`, `school` and `android` reserved with
`planned: true`, which must match zero packages and fail loudly the moment one arrives. Three
things drive the design. First, **only `pro` holds the estate lock**: the others authenticate with
a different credential set or a different entitlement declaration and share no fixtures with it, so
a 38-test Jamf Account run no longer queues behind a ~2.5 h Pro suite the way it did under the old
single `acceptance-tenant` group. Second, **a running suite is never cancelled** — there is
deliberately no workflow-level `concurrency`, because cancelling SIGKILLs `go test` and no
`CheckDestroy` or `t.Cleanup` handler runs, orphaning objects on a shared estate whose duplicate
names later collide; superseded runs queue, and a `Skip if superseded` step lets a stale one exit in
seconds. Third, **absence of a credential is fatal in a pipeline and a skip locally**, via
`JAMFPLATFORM_ACC_REQUIRE` — the failure this whole shape exists to close is the invisible one,
where a missing secret makes a suite self-skip and the package still prints `ok`. That was not
hypothetical: `acceptance.yml` referenced 48 secrets of which 13 existed, and the AI Governance
declaration was read by 18 tests and referenced nowhere. A lane that plans packages and executes
zero tests now fails with a warning banner, and one `acceptance-gate` job is the required check so
branch protection never has to name a lane. Full rules: [TESTING.md §CI scaling](TESTING.md#ci-scaling).
